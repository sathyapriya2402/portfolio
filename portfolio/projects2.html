          <h3>Project One </h3>
          <p>Authentication Based On Iris Analysis Using Reflection Removal And 2D-HMM Algorithm</p>
          <h2>Project Description</h2>
          <p>Iris recognition is considered to be the most reliable and accurate biometric
identification system. Iris recognition system captures an image of an individualâ€™s eye, the iris in the
image is meant for the further segmentation and normalization for extracting its feature. Then it is
compared with the image stored in the database to provide authentication without using any mask. The
iris recognition system has been developed to increase the security measures.The scanned iris image is
used in the system of processing.This system purely based on research and not a product</p>
